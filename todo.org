#+TITLE: Quiz.js 


* Dependencies

JQuery (?) --> going to be included in every site anyway
CSS stuff? (maybe just assume the user does that all, don't provide any default styling?)
- What about progress bar???

Need CSS:
- For progress
- For hidden (hide the next button)

* Todo

- WRITE WORKING CODE
  - Rewrite to use classes
  - Remove dependencies in html (make quiz auto generate)
  - Quiz
    - Should quiz also be quiz_handler?
    - Response handler? Assume email.php?
  - Progress bar
- Write documentation (or instructions lol)
- Writing working code then try to encapsulate it
- Get rid of responses (so aids having to create new objects)
  - Don't need new!!! But type safety of having responses is useful
  - Also put in default values for responses??
- Back button
- Enter on text questions presses the next button
- Sometimes, not everything loaded when moving question (especially icons), come up with a way to delay until everything is loaded
- Scrolling: automatically so everything is in view (maybe desktop only?)
- What to do after end of the quiz?

** TODO [1/4] Write working code

Code for creating object with dynamic key
var obj = {};
obj[key] = value;

Change button class to button instead of input_button? Don't want to lump input buttons with the next button. For some reason button is having it's onclick changed but it isn't changing?

jQuery:
- Assuming right now that there is only one buttons, question etc. on the page
- Might be better to ensure that the quiz only operates inside a quiz div or something

*** TODO Default values!! 

*** DONE Remove dependencies in html (make quiz auto generate on init)
CLOSED: [2018-04-28 Sat 18:29]

*** TODO Progress bar!!!

*** TODO Handle responses
email and question answers
- use answers object with named data?

** TODO [0/2] Other functionality

*** TODO Encapsulate library (namespace)

*** TODO Change into classes
ES6
Maybe later? Seems complicated

* Structure

Question hierarchy (??):
- Basic question == actual question string
- Extensible, can add new question types
- What possible question types are there?
  - Text == actual question, text responses
  - Button == actual question, button responses
    - Checkbox (tick multiple) == actual question, button responses, require an answer bool (minimum number of answers)
      - Implemented as buttons that become active when clicked on
    - Radio button (choose one) == actual question, button responses, confirmation required bool
  - Extended response (long textbox/textarea) ... (don't need this yet)

Response hierarchy (have tags? to access answer):
- Basic response == response text, any specific stylings (i.e., css classes)
- Button response == response text, any specific stylings (i.e., css classes)
- Text response == type (for input tag, e.g. "tel", "email"), placeholder text
